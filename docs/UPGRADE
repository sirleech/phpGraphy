phpGraphy - Upgrade procedure :
-------------------------------

!!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

  Before doing anything, BACKUP your actual phpgraphy directory (so in case something
  goes wrong by following instructions here, you're able to restore the previous state)

!!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

*********
 Summary
*********

List of instructions available when migrating from version x to version y, 
changes can be either "Code change" and/or "Database structure change", 
when there is only "Code change", this means that you don't have to do much
but to overwrite files with the new content

0.9.10+    -> 0.9.13 (Code change)
0.9.9      -> 0.9.10 (Code change)
0.9.8      -> 0.9.9  (Code change)
0.9.7      -> 0.9.8  (Code change)

---------------------------
From version 0.9.10+ to 0.9.13

  Instructions will now be generic, basically the idea is that we only support 
  'standard' modifications which are listed below:

    - Create a new theme (by using the default one as starting point)
    - Change your configuration file (conf/config.ini.php)

  Note that it's strongly recommended to copy the default theme and create a new one from it as opposed to hack the default, as it might be overwritten when upgrading resulting in the loss of your changes.

  So if you haven't done anything NOT allowed, here is the process to upgrade.

  As always, BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP, I can't stress this enough.

  
  2 ways of proceding :


    1/ For lazy people:
       Overwrite your site with the content of the new phpGraphy archive. The inconvenient of this
       method is that with the time, you might keep a lot of unused files.

    2/ For meticulous people:

       Remove everything BUT the following directories:

        - pictures/  That may sound obvious but you've all your pictures there, so you'd better not delete it :p
        - data/      If you're the using the flat file mode, a part of your database is there
        - themes/    Within this directory, you might want to remove the default/ theme in order to get the latest updates
        - conf/      Your config file is there, it's not dramatic if you loose it but...
        - logs/      Your log file is there, again not dramatic if you loose it  but...

      Then unpack the latest version of phpGraphy over your current installation and say yes when you're asked to overwrite
      files.

  NOTE: From one version to another, some configuration directives might have changed. I'm trying to preserve an ascendant
        compatibility as much as I can but to evolve, you've to do some sacrifices sometime. When loading your site,
        phpGraphy will tell you if some directives are invalid, then please refer to the manual at the Configuration
        Reference part to find out what is happening (variable is now obsolete, or format has changed, etc.)

---------------------------
From version 0.9.9 to 0.9.10

  All functions files have been moved to an new include/ subdirectory, all languages
  files have been moved to a new lang/ subdirectory, the easiest way to upgrade is:

    - Backup everything (I'll never say that enough)

    - Pay a special attention to all the files that you may have modified from the
      base installation (config.inc.php, header.inc.php, footer.inc.php, phpgraphy.css)
      as there has been some minors changes inside the default ones.

    - Overwrite your phpGraphy installation with the new version (except for the pictures
      subdirectory), for each file that you may have modified, make a diff (using your 
      favorite diff program) to report your changes into the new versions, it is
      especially important for the files listed above).

    - Then overwrite the files from the default install with the ones you've just merged.


---------------------------
From version 0.9.8 to 0.9.9


  There has been a lot of changes all around, everything in the goal to make it more
  modular, easier to customize without touching to the core program, so if you've a 
  picture directory from older versions, it will work with the new one.


  Standard Procedure:

    - Install the new version in a separate directory

    - Copy your current 'pictures/' directory under the new installation path

    - if using fast text database, copy your current 'data/' directory under the new 
      installation path

    - Edit the new 'config.inc.php' and changes the settings according your configuration.

    - Open your site in a web browser and correct eventual errors messages by modifying
      the 'config.inc.php' file.

  NOTE: If you were previously loggued-in as admin on a 0.9.8 or lower version,
        you'll have to manually delete your previous cookie in order to be able
	to continue using the admin account.
	(This is due to a change of the cookie structure)


  Changed files details for heavily customized sites:

  List of files that have changed:
    - index.php
    - lang_en.inc.php (and lang_fr.inc.php)
    - header.inc.php 
    - footer.inc.php
    - db_file.inc.php
    - db_mysql.inc.php
    - config.inc.php

  List of files that have been added/replaced:
    - functions_global.inc.php (I'll progressivly move all functions into this files)
    - functions_exif.inc.php has been replaced by functions_metadata.inc.php
    - style.inc.php has been replaced by phpgraphy.css
    - icons/delete_cross.gif
    - icons/metadata_on.gif
    - icons/metadata_off.gif

  If you have made some customization to the language file and/or the stylesheet, then
  you should take a look at new files, compare and put your previous changes into the 
  new files (Note that the way language file work has changed, please read the manual
  for details).

  Here is a list of added $txt* variables:
  $txt_dir_to_create, $txt_current_dir, $txt_upload_file_from_user, $txt_file_to_upload
  $txt_upload_file_from_url, $txt_comment_form_name, $txt_remember_me, $txt_editing
  $txt_in_directory, $txt_save, $txt_cancel, $txt_clear_all, $txt_gen_all_pics
  $txt_create_dir, $txt_logout


----------------------------
From version 0.9.7 to 0.9.8:

  Too much changes to be able to describe everything, the easiest way would be to:

    - Backup your actual phpgraphy version
    - Use your previous config file to configure the new one (many new options added but
      all the old names have been kept, so you should be able to refill the missing values).
    - There wasn't any database structure change so if you just start from scratch with the
      new code and just keep your previous pictures directory/database, it should work fine.
